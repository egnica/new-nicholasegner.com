# nicholasegner.com - Portfolio

nicholasegner.com is my personal portfolio and digital playground. Welcome! You're actually on it right now. It's a space to showcase my work, test ideas, and experiment with tools that reflect where Iâ€™m growing as both a developer and creative.

Built with performance and SEO in mind, the site is powered by Next.js, animated with Framer Motion, and hosted on AWS Amplify. It features a custom CMS structure for managing content, uses MongoDB for backend support, and is designed to let the work shine.

Every decision, from route structure to image optimization, reflects a hands-on, iterative approach to modern web development. The site grows alongside me.
