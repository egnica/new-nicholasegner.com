      paragraph(`The most underutilized SEO tool for a business might very well be YouTube.”
      
      I think most businesses think YouTube is only for influencers. Or tutorials. Or people they think are way more outgoing than them.
      
      It’s not!
      
      YouTube is the second-largest search engine in the world.
      
      And I personally see it as an underutilized asset a business can gain a foothold in for organic SEO.
      
      Hello! I’m Nicholas Egner, Creative Technologist.
      And today I’m going to show you the three parts that create what I call…
      The Video SEO Trifecta.`),
      heading(`Step 1: Make a Video`, 2),
      paragraph(`This video can be a talking head… just like this.
      
      Talk about something from your real client work.
      Something that hits Google’s E-E-A-T:
      
      Experience – You speak from real projects.
      Expertise – You explain what you’ve learned.
      Authoritativeness – You consistently publish content.
      Trustworthiness – Your face + your name build credibility.
      
      Now shoot that video — I’m using OBS.
      Now you have a little video nugget you can share with the world.
      “Aww… isn’t he cute!”`),
      heading(`Step 2: Upload to Your Branded YouTube Channel`, 2),
      paragraph(`Fill out the metadata. Create a thumbnail. Write a real description.
      
      Now here’s the key… keep it Unlisted for a moment.
      Because we’re about to complete the loop.`),
      heading(`Step 3: Make the Video the Focal Point of a Blog Post`, 2),
      paragraph(`If you wrote a script — that’s your text for the blog post. Google can crawl that text.
      
      If you didn’t — YouTube auto-transcribes your video.
      Clean it up.
      Add a proper H1 title.
      Break it into H2 sections.
      Embed the new video at the top.
      
      Personally, I host my videos outside of YouTube — I use AWS S3 — so I control the branding with no commercials.
      
      Now your page has:
      • A video
      • Structured text
      • Real headings
      
      That’s powerful.`),
      heading(`Close the Loop`, 2),
      paragraph(`Now here’s where it gets even better.
      
      Link your YouTube video URL inside the blog post.
      Then go back to YouTube and link the blog post URL in the description.
      
      That’s called cross-linking.
      You’re closing the loop.
      
      Now… (kendrick lamar energy)
      Bing-bop-boom-boom-boom-bop-bam.
      You’ve completed the Video Trifecta!
      Video → Blog → YouTube.
      
      Now switch your video on YouTube from Unlisted to Public.`),
      heading(`Why This Works`, 2),
      paragraph(`Google now sees:
      
      • Your YouTube video
      • Your article
      • Your website
      
      All pointing to the same creator.
      
      Now you’re building authority.
      Every time you repeat this process, your E-E-A-T grows.`),
      heading(`Bonus Level: Entity Lock-In`, 2),
      paragraph(`Let’s take this a little farther. (Squints like Sandlot.)
      
      Use JSON-LD.
      There’s an object called sameAs.
      This is where you link your YouTube channel, your website, your LinkedIn, and your other socials.
      
      Now Google recognizes you as a complete entity.
      
      Set your page’s schema type to VideoObject.
      There are lots of valuable things you can put in that object.
      
      This tells Google, in a structured way, that this page contains a video.
      You’re not hoping Google figures it out.
      You’re explicitly labeling it.
      
      Now your page becomes eligible to appear in:
      • Video search results
      • Rich results with thumbnails
      • And sometimes even key moments
      
      That’s not a trick.
      That’s structured clarity.`),
      heading(`Close`, 2),
      paragraph(`You don’t need to be an influencer.
      You need a system.
      
      Video.
      Blog.
      Structured data.
      Repeat.
      
      That’s how authority compounds.
      
      And if you want help building that system. I offer free website and content consultations.
      Let’s make sure your digital presence is working as hard as you are.`),
